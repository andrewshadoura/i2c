Todo:
* don't include the source files, link them instead; that requires dropping
  'static' keyword from some symbols, however
* don't do i/o mapping unconditionally in the Open(), consult the driver first
* add probe function to the driver
* the code's C, not C++, so why do you check for C++ and name the sources .cpp?
* it's better to use standard <stdint.h> integer types like uint8_t
* fix the Sleep() issue

Wishlist items:
+ try to build with MinGW (and write a simple Makefile)
* write code Doxygen-style comments and process with Doxygen to make docs
* add support for more chips
* ...
* PROFIT!
* total and utter world domination
